## Coverage Report

This module gathers aggregated jacoco test coverage metrics across the `gax-java` and `showcase` modules. The purpose of
the metrics is to provide insights into how much of GAX code is being exercised by showcase and GAX tests and where 
(unit tests versus integration tests). They will also provide information on any change in coverage observed
as showcase tests continue to be added to the repository.

### Unit Test Coverage
In order to view aggregate unit test coverage of GAX in both `gax-java` and `showcase`:

1. At the root of the repository, run `mvn clean test -DenableTestCoverage`.
2. The metrics can be found at `gapic-generator-java/coverage-report/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/index.html`

### Integration Test Coverage

In order to view aggregate integration test coverage of GAX in both `gax-java` and `showcase`:

1. At the root of the repository, run `mvn clean verify -DskipUnitTests -DenableTestCoverage -Penable-integration-tests`.
2. The metrics can be found at `gapic-generator-java/coverage-report/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/index.html`
