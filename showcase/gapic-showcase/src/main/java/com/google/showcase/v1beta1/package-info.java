/**
 * A client to Client Libraries Showcase API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= ComplianceClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: This service is used to test that GAPICs implement various REST-related
 * features correctly. This mostly means transcoding proto3 requests to REST format correctly for
 * various types of HTTP annotations, but it also includes verifying that unknown (numeric) enums
 * received by clients can be round-tripped correctly.
 *
 * <p>Sample for ComplianceClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (ComplianceClient complianceClient = ComplianceClient.create()) {
 *   RepeatRequest request =
 *       RepeatRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setName("name3373707")
 *           .setInfo(ComplianceData.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setServerVerify(true)
 *           .setIntendedBindingUri("intendedBindingUri780142386")
 *           .setFInt32(-1143775883)
 *           .setFInt64(-1143775788)
 *           .setFDouble(-1239459382)
 *           .setPInt32(-858673665)
 *           .setPInt64(-858673570)
 *           .setPDouble(-991225216)
 *           .build();
 *   RepeatResponse response = complianceClient.repeatDataBody(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>======================= EchoClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: This service is used showcase the four main types of rpcs - unary, server
 * side streaming, client side streaming, and bidirectional streaming. This service also exposes
 * methods that explicitly implement server delay, and paginated calls. Set the 'showcase-trailer'
 * metadata key on any method to have the values echoed in the response trailers. Set the
 * 'x-goog-request-params' metadata key on any method to have the values echoed in the response
 * headers.
 *
 * <p>Sample for EchoClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.

 *           .setOtherHeader("otherHeader-2026585667")
 *           .build();
