# This is the entrypoint script for java owlbot. This is not intended to be
# called directly but rather be called from postproces_library.sh
# For reference, the positional arguments are
# 1: scripts_root: location of the root of the library_generation scripts. When
# in a Docker container, this value should be /src/
# 2: versions_file: points to a versions.txt containing versions to be applied
# both to README and pom.xml files
# 3: is_monorepo: whether we are postprocessing a monorepo
# 4: libraries_bom_version: used to render the readme

# The scripts assumes the CWD is the folder where postprocessing is going to be
# applied

# when `docker run`ning with the -u flag because we may incur in users
# not registered in the container's /etc/passwd file
