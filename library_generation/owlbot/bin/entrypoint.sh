# This is the entrypoint script for java owlbot. This is not intended to be
# called directly but rather be called from postproces_library.sh
# For reference, the positional arguments are
# 1: scripts_root: location of postprocess_library.sh
# 2: versions_file: points to a versions.txt containing versions to be applied
# both to README and pom.xml files

# The scripts assumes the CWD is the folder where postprocessing is going to be
# applied
