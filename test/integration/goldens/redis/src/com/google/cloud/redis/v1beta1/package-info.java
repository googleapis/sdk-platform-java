/**
 * A client to Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= CloudRedisClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Configures and manages Cloud Memorystore for Redis instances
 *
 * <p>Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis v1beta1
 *
 * <p>The `redis.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis API and
 * defines the following resource model for managing Redis instances:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/&#42;`
 *   <li>Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/&#42;`
 *   <li>Each location has a collection of Redis instances, named: `/instances/&#42;`
 *   <li>As such, Redis instances are resources of the form:
 *       `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that location_id must be referring to a GCP `region`; for example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>`projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/instances/my-redis`
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Sample for CloudRedisClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (CloudRedisClient cloudRedisClient = CloudRedisClient.create()) {
 *   InstanceName name = InstanceName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[INSTANCE]");
 *   Instance response = cloudRedisClient.getInstance(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
