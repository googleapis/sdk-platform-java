 * <p>======================= IamCredentialsClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: A service account is a special type of Google account that belongs to
 * your application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an individual end user. Your
 * application assumes the identity of the service account to call Google APIs, so that the users
 * aren't directly involved.
 *
 * <p>Service account credentials are used to temporarily assume the identity of the service
 * account. Supported credential types include OAuth 2.0 access tokens, OpenID Connect ID tokens,
 * self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and more.
 *
 * <p>Sample for IamCredentialsClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (IamCredentialsClient iamCredentialsClient = IamCredentialsClient.create()) {
 *   ServiceAccountName name = ServiceAccountName.of("[PROJECT]", "[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]");
 *   List<String> delegates = new ArrayList<>();
 *   List<String> scope = new ArrayList<>();
 *   Duration lifetime = Duration.newBuilder().build();
 *   GenerateAccessTokenResponse response =
 *       iamCredentialsClient.generateAccessToken(name, delegates, scope, lifetime);
 * }
 * }</pre>
