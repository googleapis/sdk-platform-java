/**
 * Service Description: ## API Overview
 *
 * <p>Manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
 *
 * <p>Any implementation of an API that offers access control features implements the
 * google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy interface.
 *
 * <p>## Data model
 *
 * <p>Access control is applied when a principal (user or service account), takes some action on a
 * resource exposed by a service. Resources, identified by URI-like names, are the unit of access
 * control specification. Service implementations can choose the granularity of access control and
 * the supported permissions for their resources. For example one database service may allow access
 * control to be specified only at the Table level, whereas another might allow access control to
 * also be specified at the Column level.
 *
 * <p>## Policy Structure
 *
 * <p>See google.iam.v1.Policy
 *
 * <p>This is intentionally not a CRUD style API because access control policies are created and
 * deleted implicitly with the resources to which they are attached.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (IAMPolicyClient iAMPolicyClient = IAMPolicyClient.create()) {
 *   SetIamPolicyRequest request =
 *       SetIamPolicyRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setResource("SetIamPolicyRequest1223629066".toString())
 *           .setPolicy(Policy.newBuilder().build())
 *           .build();
 *   Policy response = iAMPolicyClient.setIamPolicy(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the IAMPolicyClient object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of IAMPolicySettings to create().
 * For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * IAMPolicySettings iAMPolicySettings =
 *     IAMPolicySettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * IAMPolicyClient iAMPolicyClient = IAMPolicyClient.create(iAMPolicySettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * IAMPolicySettings iAMPolicySettings =
 *     IAMPolicySettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * IAMPolicyClient iAMPolicyClient = IAMPolicyClient.create(iAMPolicySettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
