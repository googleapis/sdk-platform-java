/**
 * Service Description: API Overview
 *
 * <p>Manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
 *
 * <p>Any implementation of an API that offers access control features implements the
 * google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy interface.
 *
 * <p>## Data model
 *
 * <p>Access control is applied when a principal (user or service account), takes some action on a
 * resource exposed by a service. Resources, identified by URI-like names, are the unit of access
 * control specification. Service implementations can choose the granularity of access control and
 * the supported permissions for their resources. For example one database service may allow access
 * control to be specified only at the Table level, whereas another might allow access control to
 * also be specified at the Column level.
 *
 * <p>## Policy Structure
 *
 * <p>See google.iam.v1.Policy
 *
 * <p>This is intentionally not a CRUD style API because access control policies are created and
 * deleted implicitly with the resources to which they are attached.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (IAMPolicyClient iAMPolicyClient = IAMPolicyClient.create()) {
 *   SetIamPolicyRequest request =
 *       SetIamPolicyRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setResource("SetIamPolicyRequest1223629066".toString())
 *           .setPolicy(Policy.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setUpdateMask(FieldMask.newBuilder().build())
 *           .build();
 *   Policy response = iAMPolicyClient.setIamPolicy(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the IAMPolicyClient object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * <table>

 *  If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
 *  permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

 *  UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation

 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of IAMPolicySettings to create().
 * For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * IAMPolicySettings iAMPolicySettings =
 *     IAMPolicySettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * IAMPolicyClient iAMPolicyClient = IAMPolicyClient.create(iAMPolicySettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * IAMPolicySettings iAMPolicySettings =
 *     IAMPolicySettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * IAMPolicyClient iAMPolicyClient = IAMPolicyClient.create(iAMPolicySettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
