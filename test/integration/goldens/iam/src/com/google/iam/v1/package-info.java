 * <p>======================= IAMPolicyClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: API Overview
 *
 * <p>Manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
 *
 * <p>Any implementation of an API that offers access control features implements the
 * google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy interface.
 *
 * <p>## Data model
 *
 * <p>Access control is applied when a principal (user or service account), takes some action on a
 * resource exposed by a service. Resources, identified by URI-like names, are the unit of access
 * control specification. Service implementations can choose the granularity of access control and
 * the supported permissions for their resources. For example one database service may allow access
 * control to be specified only at the Table level, whereas another might allow access control to
 * also be specified at the Column level.
 *
 * <p>## Policy Structure
 *
 * <p>See google.iam.v1.Policy
 *
 * <p>This is intentionally not a CRUD style API because access control policies are created and
 * deleted implicitly with the resources to which they are attached.
 *
 * <p>Sample for IAMPolicyClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (IAMPolicyClient iAMPolicyClient = IAMPolicyClient.create()) {
 *   SetIamPolicyRequest request =
 *       SetIamPolicyRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setResource("resource-341064690")
 *           .setPolicy(Policy.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setUpdateMask(FieldMask.newBuilder().build())
 *           .build();
 *   Policy response = iAMPolicyClient.setIamPolicy(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
