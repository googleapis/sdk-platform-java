// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: Services
 *
 * <p>The Addresses API.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (AddressesClient addressesClient = AddressesClient.create()) {
 *   String project = "project-309310695";
 *   for (Map.Entry<String, AddressesScopedList> element :
 *       addressesClient.aggregatedList(project).iterateAll()) {
 *     // doThingsWith(element);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the AddressesClient object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().

 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of AddressesSettings to create().
 * For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AddressesSettings addressesSettings =
 *     AddressesSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * AddressesClient addressesClient = AddressesClient.create(addressesSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AddressesSettings addressesSettings =
 *     AddressesSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * AddressesClient addressesClient = AddressesClient.create(addressesSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
