/**
 * Service Description: The RegionOperations API.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (RegionOperationsClient regionOperationsClient = RegionOperationsClient.create()) {
 *   String project = "project-309310695";
 *   String region = "region-934795532";
 *   String operation = "operation1662702951";
 *   Operation response = regionOperationsClient.get(project, region, operation);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the RegionOperationsClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <table>
 *    <tr>
 *      <th>Method</th>
 *      <th>Description</th>
 *      <th>Method Variants</th>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td>Get</td>
 *      <td><p>Retrieves the specified region-specific Operations resource.</p></td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Request object method variants only take one parameter, a request object, which must be constructed before the call.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>get(GetRegionOperationRequest request)
 *      </ul>
 *      <p>"Flattened" method variants have converted the fields of the request object into function parameters to enable multiple ways to call the same method.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>get(String project, String region, String operation)
 *      </ul>
 *      <p>Callable method variants take no parameters and return an immutable API callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>getCallable()
 *      </ul>
 *    </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td>Wait</td>
 *      <td><p>Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress.
 *
 *  This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
 *  - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds.
 *  - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.</p></td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Request object method variants only take one parameter, a request object, which must be constructed before the call.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>wait(WaitRegionOperationRequest request)
 *      </ul>
 *      <p>"Flattened" method variants have converted the fields of the request object into function parameters to enable multiple ways to call the same method.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>wait(String project, String region, String operation)

 *      </ul>
 *    </td>
 *    </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of RegionOperationsSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * RegionOperationsSettings regionOperationsSettings =
 *     RegionOperationsSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * RegionOperationsClient regionOperationsClient =
 *     RegionOperationsClient.create(regionOperationsSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * RegionOperationsSettings regionOperationsSettings =
 *     RegionOperationsSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * RegionOperationsClient regionOperationsClient =
 *     RegionOperationsClient.create(regionOperationsSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
