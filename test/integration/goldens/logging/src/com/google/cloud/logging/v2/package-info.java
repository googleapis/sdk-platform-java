/**
 * A client to Cloud Logging API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= LoggingClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Service for ingesting and querying logs.
 *
 * <p>Sample for LoggingClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (LoggingClient loggingClient = LoggingClient.create()) {
 *   LogName logName = LogName.ofProjectLogName("[PROJECT]", "[LOG]");
 *   loggingClient.deleteLog(logName);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>======================= ConfigClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Service for configuring sinks used to route log entries.
 *
 * <p>Sample for ConfigClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (ConfigClient configClient = ConfigClient.create()) {
 *   GetBucketRequest request =
 *       GetBucketRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setName(
 *               LogBucketName.ofProjectLocationBucketName("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[BUCKET]")
 *                   .toString())
 *           .build();
 *   LogBucket response = configClient.getBucket(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>======================= MetricsClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Service for configuring logs-based metrics.
 *
 * <p>Sample for MetricsClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
