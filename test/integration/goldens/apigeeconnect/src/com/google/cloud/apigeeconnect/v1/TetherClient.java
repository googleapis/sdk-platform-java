/**
 * Service Description: Tether provides a way for the control plane to send HTTP API requests to
 * services in data planes that runs in a remote datacenter without requiring customers to open
 * firewalls on their runtime plane.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (TetherClient tetherClient = TetherClient.create()) {
 *   BidiStream<EgressResponse, EgressRequest> bidiStream = tetherClient.egressCallable().call();
 *   EgressResponse request =
 *       EgressResponse.newBuilder()
 *           .setId("id3355")
 *           .setHttpResponse(HttpResponse.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setStatus(Status.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setProject("project-309310695")
 *           .setTraceId("traceId-1067401920")
 *           .setEndpoint(TetherEndpoint.forNumber(0))
 *           .setName("name3373707")
 *           .build();
 *   bidiStream.send(request);
 *   for (EgressRequest response : bidiStream) {
 *     // Do something when a response is received.
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the TetherClient object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of TetherSettings to create().
 * For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * TetherSettings tetherSettings =
 *     TetherSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * TetherClient tetherClient = TetherClient.create(tetherSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * TetherSettings tetherSettings = TetherSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * TetherClient tetherClient = TetherClient.create(tetherSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.

   * Egress streams egress requests and responses. Logically, this is not actually a streaming
   * request, but uses streaming as a mechanism to flip the client-server relationship of gRPC so
   * that the server can act as a client. The listener, the RPC server, accepts connections from the
   * dialer, the RPC client. The listener streams http requests and the dialer streams http
   * responses.
