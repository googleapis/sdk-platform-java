/**
 * Indicates a public API that is stable for callers to use, but has no guarantee of stability for
 * extension. Consequently, the API should only be extended within the package containing the API.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An interface marked with this annotation can have new methods added to it.</li>
 * <li>A non-final class with this annotation can be marked final.</li>
 * <li>A class with this annotation can have new abstract methods added.</li>
 * <li>a non-final method with this annotation can be marked final.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The list above is just for illustration purposes and is not exhaustive.
 *
 * <p>
 * Adding this annotation to an API is considered API-breaking.
