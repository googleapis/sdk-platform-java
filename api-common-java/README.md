API Common for Java is a library for foundational types relating to Google
APIs. It currently contains the following packages:
- core: Core library containing API stability annotations and wrappers around
  Guava types
- pathtemplate: Path Template library for manipulating strings that are
  formatted as Google API resource names.
- resourcenames: Resource Name library used by generated resource name types

> For new and existing Developers/ Contributors:
>
> In December 2022, api-common-java's build tool has been migrated from gradle to maven.
> Gradle related files are no longer being maintained and will be removed.
>
> The artifact coordinates in Maven Central (`{{ group_id }}:{{ artifact_id }}`) remain the same.

Versioning
----------

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), but with some
additional qualifications:

1. Components marked with `@BetaApi` are considered to be "0.x" features inside
   a "1.x" library. This means they can change between minor and patch releases
   in incompatible ways. These features should not be used by any library "B"
   that itself has consumers, unless the components of library B that use
   `@BetaApi` features are also marked with `@BetaApi`. Features marked as
   `@BetaApi` are on a path to eventually become "1.x" features with the marker
   removed.
1. Components marked with `@InternalApi` are technically public, but are only
   public for technical reasons, because of the limitations of Java's access
   modifiers. For the purposes of semver, they should be considered private.

This library is currently in major version one (``1.y.z``), which means that
any public API not specifically marked as `@BetaApi` or `@InternalApi` can be considered
stable. They will not change without incrementing the major version to 2.x or later,
and probably not then.
