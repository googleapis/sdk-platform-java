# Java GAPIC Generator for Librarian (librariangen)

This directory contains the source code for `librariangen`, a containerized Go application that serves as the Java-specific code generator within the Librarian pipeline. Its responsibility is to generate release-ready Java GAPIC client libraries from `googleapis` API definitions, replacing the legacy Java hermetic code generation toolchain.
