/**
 * The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= EchoClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: This service is used showcase the four main types of rpcs - unary, server
 * side streaming, client side streaming, and bidirectional streaming. This service also exposes
 * methods that explicitly implement server delay, and paginated calls. Set the 'showcase-trailer'
 * metadata key on any method to have the values echoed in the response trailers.
 *
 * <p>Sample for EchoClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (EchoClient echoClient = EchoClient.create()) {
 *   EchoResponse response = echoClient.echo();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>======================= EchoAgainClient =======================
