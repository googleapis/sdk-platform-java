/**
 * Holds the parameters for <b>retry</b> or <b>poll</b> logic with jitter, timeout and exponential
 * backoff. Actual implementation of the logic is elsewhere.
 *
 * <p>The intent of these settings is to be used with a call to a remote server, which could either
 * fail (and return an error code) or not respond (and cause a timeout). When there is a failure or
 * timeout, the logic should keep trying until the total timeout has passed.
 *
 * <p>The "total timeout" and "max attempts" settings have ultimate control over how long the logic
 * should keep trying the remote call until it gives up completely. The remote call will be retried
 * until one of those thresholds is crossed. To avoid unbounded rpc calls, it is required to
 * configure one of those settings. If both are 0, then retries will be disabled. The other settings
 * are considered more advanced.
 *
 * <p>Retry delay and timeout start at specific values, and are tracked separately from each other.
 * The very first call (before any retries) will use the initial timeout.
 *
 * <p>If the last remote call is a failure, then the retrier will wait for the current retry delay
 * before attempting another call, and then the retry delay will be multiplied by the retry delay
 * multiplier for the next failure. The timeout will not be affected, except in the case where the
 * timeout would result in a deadline past the total timeout; in that circumstance, a new timeout
 * value is computed which will terminate the call when the total time is up.
 *
 * <p>If the last remote call is a timeout, then the retrier will compute a new timeout and make
 * another call. The new timeout is computed by multiplying the current timeout by the timeout
 * multiplier, but if that results in a deadline after the total timeout, then a new timeout value
 * is computed which will terminate the call when the total time is up.
 *
 * <p>Server streaming RPCs interpret RPC timeouts a bit differently. For server streaming RPCs, the
 * RPC timeout gets converted into a wait timeout {@link
 * com.google.api.gax.rpc.ApiCallContext#withStreamWaitTimeoutDuration(java.time.Duration)}.
 *
 * <p>In Cloud Client Libraries, Retry and LRO Retry Settings may be configured for each RPC in a
 * service. These values are chosen by the service teams and may be found by looking at the
 * {Service}StubSettings.java file in each library. The default values listed below for each
 * configuration are the default values for the RetrySettings class if there are no RPC specific
 * configurations from the Service Team.
